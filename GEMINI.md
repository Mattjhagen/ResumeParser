## July 5, 2025 - Debugging PDF Upload & Render API Error

### Problem Description

The user reported two related errors:
1.  A "failed to generate portfolio" message on the website's frontend when uploading a PDF.
2.  An `APIError.generate` error in the Render deployment logs, originating from the OpenAI library.

### Investigation & Diagnosis

1.  **Code Review:** I examined `server.js` (backend) and `generate-portfolio.js` (frontend) to understand the workflow.
2.  **Client-Side Issue:** The review of `generate-portfolio.js` revealed that the client-side code was intentionally blocking PDF uploads and was only designed to handle `.txt` files. This was the direct cause of the frontend error message.
3.  **Server-Side Issue:** The `APIError` from the OpenAI library on the server strongly indicated an authentication problem. This typically happens when the API key is missing, invalid, or has exceeded its quota. The server-side code in `server.js` was correctly set up to receive text and make the API call, but it was failing at the point of contact with the OpenAI service.

### Resolution Steps

1.  **Implement Client-Side PDF Parsing:**
    *   Modified `generate-portfolio.js` to handle PDF files. The new logic uses the `pdf.js` library to extract text content from the PDF directly within the user's browser.
    *   Modified `index.html` to include the `pdf.js` library from a CDN, making the parsing functionality available to the client.
2.  **Address Server-Side API Key Issue:**
    *   After fixing the client-side file handling, the root cause of the Render error remained.
    *   I advised the user to verify that their `OPENAI_API_KEY` and/or `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variables were correctly configured in the Render service dashboard. This is the most likely cause of the `APIError`.

The frontend is now equipped to process PDFs, and the remaining action lies with the user to confirm their server-side environment variables are set correctly.
