# AI Resume Parser & Portfolio Generator

This project uses AI to parse resumes and automatically generate beautiful, personalized portfolio websites with unique subdomains.

## How It Works

1.  **Resume Upload:** A user uploads their resume (PDF or text file).
2.  **AI Data Extraction:** The backend server sends the resume text to an AI (OpenAI or Gemini) to extract structured data like name, experience, skills, and even inferred personality and industry.
3.  **AI Portfolio Generation:** The extracted data is then used in a second, more advanced AI prompt. This prompt instructs the AI to act as a professional web developer and create a complete, custom HTML/CSS website tailored to the user.
4.  **Subdomain Creation:** The server generates a unique subdomain for the new site.
5.  **DNS Configuration:** It uses the Cloudflare API to automatically create a `CNAME` record for the new subdomain, pointing it to the main application server.
6.  **Deployment:** The generated HTML is saved, and the site becomes instantly available at the new subdomain.

## Embedding in Your Existing Website

You can easily embed the resume parser into any existing website without altering its look and feel. The parser is designed to be placed inside a specific `<div>` on your page.

### Step 1: Add the HTML Snippet

Place the following HTML code wherever you want the resume upload section to appear on your site:

```html
<div id="resume-parser-container">
  <h2>Generate Your AI Portfolio</h2>
  <p>Upload your resume (plain text or PDF) and let our AI create a personalized portfolio website for you in seconds.</p>
  <input type="file" id="resumeFile" accept=".txt,.pdf" />
  <button id="generatePortfolioBtn">Generate Portfolio</button>
  <div id="loadingMessage" style="display: none; color: #333;">Generating your portfolio...</div>
  <div id="portfolioOutput" style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
</div>
```

### Step 2: Add the JavaScript

Include the following JavaScript file in your HTML. This script contains all the logic for handling file uploads and communicating with the backend.

```html
<script src="https://your-render-service-url.onrender.com/generate-portfolio.js"></script>
```

**Important:** Replace `https://your-render-service-url.onrender.com` with the actual URL of your deployed Render service.

### Step 3: Add the PDF.js Library

To enable client-side PDF parsing, you need to include the `pdf.js` library. Add these script tags to your HTML file, preferably before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.11.338/pdf.min.js"></script>
<script>
    pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.11.338/pdf.worker.min.js`;
</script>
```

That's it! The resume parser will now be fully integrated into your site.

## "Create Your Own" Button

Every portfolio site generated by this application will automatically include a small, floating button in the bottom-right corner that says "Create Your Own AI Portfolio". This button links back to your main resume parser website, allowing you to grow your user base organically.

## Next Steps: Premium Features

The following features are planned to monetize the service and provide additional value to users.

### Stripe Integration for Payments

To offer premium features like custom domains, we will integrate Stripe for payment processing.

1.  **Create a Stripe Product:** Set up a new product in the Stripe Dashboard for the "Custom Domain" feature.
2.  **Add a "Buy" Button:** On the generated portfolio page, add a "Get a Custom Domain" button that redirects to a Stripe Checkout session.
3.  **Create a Webhook Endpoint:** Create a new API endpoint in `server.js` (e.g., `/api/stripe-webhook`) to listen for events from Stripe, specifically the `checkout.session.completed` event.
4.  **Fulfill the Order:** When a payment is successful, the webhook will trigger the custom domain registration process.

### Dynadot Integration for Custom Domains

We will use the Dynadot API to programmatically search for and register custom domains for users who have paid for the feature.

1.  **Domain Search:** After a user clicks the "Get a Custom Domain" button, they will be prompted to search for an available domain.
2.  **API Integration:** The server will use the Dynadot API to check for domain availability.
3.  **Domain Registration:** Once a user has paid via Stripe and selected an available domain, the server will use the Dynadot API to register the domain on their behalf.
4.  **DNS Configuration:** After registration, the server will use the Dynadot API to set the `A` record for the new domain to point to the Render service's IP address, making the user's portfolio live at their new custom domain.
